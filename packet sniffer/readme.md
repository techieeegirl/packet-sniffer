# Packet Sniffer
A java project that uses swing for frontend and Jpcap library to capture and monitor real time network traffic on multitude of hardware and virtual network interfaces.
## Capabilities
1. We can capture live network traffic with JpCap library.
2. The packet types that are implemented are TCP, UDP and ICMP.
3. We can export the packets in .txt file.
## Dependencies
1. JpCap library (jpcap.jar)
2. JpCap.dll
3. javax.xml.bind.jar
## Note
To execute, we need to add third party library dependencies that are present in "lib" directory.
In intelliJ Idea we can add the library dependencies in project "Module" settings.
After this we can run our "main" method under "src" directory.
